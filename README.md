  How to use:
  1. Unzip the nnet/nnet.mat.7z.001 
  
     Use the command: 7z e nnet/nnet.mat.7z.001
     
  2. Add "SignalGraph" toolbox in the matlab path
  
     Clone the SignalGraph: git clone https://github.com/singaxiong/SignalGraph.git
     
     Change matlab workplace to SignalGraph folder and run: AddMyPath
     
     If you want to use gpu, run: gpuDevice()
     
  3. Run: [eTDOA, eDOA] = evalSCMTDOA_music('./data')
